title: Magic
---

Magic is a category into which have been placed various beliefs and practices considered separate from both religion and science. Emerging within [[Western culture]], the term has historically often had pejorative connotations, with things labelled magical perceived as being socially unacceptable, primitive, or foreign. The concept has been adopted by scholars in the humanities and social sciences, who have proposed various different—and often mutually exclusive—definitions of the term. Many contemporary scholars regard the concept to be so problematic that they reject it altogether.
